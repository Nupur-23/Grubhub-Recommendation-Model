# 💡 Insights Derived
Personalized Recommendations: The recommendation model provides personalized restaurant suggestions based on user preferences, determines the best location for opening a restaurant.

User Engagement: Analyzing user interactions with recommended restaurants and tracking user feedback helps refine the recommendation algorithm.

Restaurant Insights: By analyzing user preferences, restaurant owners can gain insights into customer preferences, leading to menu optimization and targeted promotions.


# 🚀 Future Scope
User Feedback Loop: Implement a feedback mechanism to capture user preferences and continuously update the recommendation model.

Geo-Location Integration: Integrate real-time location data to recommend nearby restaurants and delivery options

Market Expansion: Extend the recommendation system to other cities and regions to reach a broader user base.
